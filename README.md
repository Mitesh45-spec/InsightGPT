InsightGPT 🚀_context
InsightGPT is an advanced natural language processing (NLP) solution that uses **transformers, semantic search and generative AI** to create **explainable insights** at an **aspect level** from large amounts of customer feedback (for example, via reviews, surveys, or customer service channels). As result, InsightGPT provides organisations with a way to create porposeful **decision-making intelligence** (i.e., how organisations like senior leadership or product teams should respond to things based on the information they have received).

🔍 Problem Statement
In today's world, organisations are getting inundated (flooded) with large amounts of **unstructured** (items that cannot be easily categorised or collected) customer feedback (for example, via reviews, surveys, or customer service channels) and therefore do not know what to do with these large amounts of **unstructured** feedback. Most traditional NLPs provide organisations with one piece of information - the *overall* **sentiment** (i.e., how happy a person is overall) from a review; however, most do not tell organisations the *why, which*, or *how* to change their decisions based on this information:

- Why is the customer dissatisfied?
- Which features (product components) are causing customers to leave?  
- What has the customer's perception of their experience changed over the period of time they have owned their product?  
- What should senior leadership focus on next?  

InsightGPT uses **aspect-based sentiment**, **explainable AI**, **semantic search**, and **language model summary** technologies to help organisations fill in the gaps between their customers and senior leadership.
